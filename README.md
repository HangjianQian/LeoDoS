# LeoDoS - The AQM&DoS Simulation Platform

The Active Queue Management and Denial-of-Service (AQM&DoS) Simulation Platform is based on the Network Simulation 2. It is able to simulate a variety of experimental scenarios related to Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks and Active Queue Management (AQM) algorithms.

## The platform can simulate numbers of Denial-of-Service attacks:

* Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks
* Distributed Deinal-of-Service (DDoS) attacks
* Spoofing DoS or DDoS attacks
* Distributed Low-rate Denial-of-Service (DLDoS) attacks
* Spoofing LDoS or DLDoS attacks

## The platform supports many Active Queue Management (AQM) algorithms:

* 1 DropTail; 2 RED; 3 RED/PD; 4 Blue; 5 SFB;
* 6 CBQ; 7 FQ; 8 SFQ; 9 DRR; 10 PI;
* 11 Vq; 12 REM; 13 GK; 14 SRR;
* 15 RED/Robust (RRED) 16 SFB/Robust (RSFB);

## The platform support a number of topologies:

* Dumb Bell
* Tree
* Line
* Internet
* And you can define new topologies with ease.

To analyse the impact of DoS attacks on normal TCP flows and AQM algorithms, this platform also provides mechanisms to automatically calculate and record the average throughput of normal TCP flows before and after DoS attacks.
